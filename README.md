# Diabetes-Final-Prediction
This project aims to predict diabetes via three different supervised machine learning methods including: SVM, Logistic regression, KNN. This project also aims to propose an effective technique for earlier detection of the diabetes disease using Machine learning algorithms and end to end deployment using flask
